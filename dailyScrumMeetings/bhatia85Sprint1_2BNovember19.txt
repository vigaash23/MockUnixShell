What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on implementing the design for the Remove class
    - Made changes to the MakeDirectory class to allow for any amount of folders

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Do some testing for edge cases of the Remove class
    - Finish implementing everything in the ErrorChecker to allow MakeDirectory to function with multiple parameters

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently, no I am not blocked on anything.
