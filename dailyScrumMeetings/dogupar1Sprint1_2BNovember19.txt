What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Implemented and finished the new Cat class
	- Implemented the base code for the Move class
	- Implemented the base code for the Copy class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Testing and playing around with the implementations to verify
      that these classes are good to go

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I do not believe that I am blocked on anything at the moment
